"US agency leading Musk's firing spree to hire new driver, emails show","WASHINGTON, March 31 (Reuters) - The federal human-resources agency leading efforts by billionaire White House adviserElon Muskto slash the federal workforce has decided to hire its first new career employee since PresidentDonald Trumptook office, according to emails seen by Reuters.
The position is a new driver to ferry around leaders of that agency, the Office of Personnel Management, the emails indicate.
OPM's acting director, Chuck Ezell, last week authorized an exemption to a government-wide hiring freeze to replace one of two drivers for agency leadership after one retired in mid-March, according to the messages.
The decision, not previously reported, shows thatMusk's Department of Government Efficiency, which is directing the cuts, is not making the government more effective, said Kathleen Clark, a professor of ethics at Washington University in St. Louis.
""It is becoming increasingly obvious that Musk’s & DOGE’s mission has absolutely nothing to do with efficiency, and instead is aimed at enabling Musk to use - and abuse - power within the federal government,"" she said.
""Authorizing a Musk-controlled agency like OPM to hire a driver while slashing essential federal workers who actually help Americans in need is a good example.""
The White House, DOGE, Musk and Ezell did not respond to requests for comment. An OPM spokesperson said in a statement that the agency ""has ongoing security concerns"" requiring a driver, without providing further detail. Ezell said he hasreceived death threats, opens new tabin the role in an interview last month with byFaith, which describes itself as the Magazine of the Presbyterian Church in America.
One of Trump's first acts as president was to create DOGE, to root out waste, fraud and abuse, slash government spending and purge the federal workforce of low-performing, disloyal and unnecessary workers.
Trump has said he is ""very proud"" of what he describes as a vital initiative to turn off the spigot of wasteful spending.
In practice, some sayDOGE has mostly pursued long-time Republican policy objectives, shuttering agencies such as USAID and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which provide a lifeline to the world's needy and protect Americans from unscrupulous lender respectively.
It has also announced drastic cuts at departments that provide critical social services including the Department of Veterans Affairs, which administers healthcare for veterans, and the Social Security Administration, which sends out checks to retired, disabled and widowed Americans.
OPM, which has led the charge on federal government firings, has laid off more than 200 of its own employees and allowed over 400 to opt in to voluntary exit programs since Trump took office, two people familiar with the matter said.",https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-agency-leading-musks-firing-spree-hire-new-driver-emails-show-2025-03-31/
"In a change of course, US Justice Dept drops challenge to Georgia voting law","WASHINGTON, March 31 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's Justice Department said on Monday it was pulling out of a lawsuit that challenges a Republican-backed Georgia election law as discriminatory, abandoning a position it took under Democratic President Joe Biden.
U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said recent increases in Black voter turnout in the battleground state refuted the lawsuit's claim that the 2021 law, whichmandated new voting requirements, amounted to voter suppression.
""Georgians deserve secure elections, not fabricated claims of false voter suppression meant to divide us,"" Bondi said in a statement.
The move was the latest in aseries of actionsby the Justice Department to end Biden-era civil rights actions andshift the focusof the Civil Rights Division to pursue conservative causes.
The law is also being challenged by several civil rights groups including the Georgia chapter of the NAACP, which said it would continue its effort.
""When the government drops the ball and turns a blind eye to injustice, we will step in,"" Gerald Griggs, the president of the Georgia NAACP chapter, told Reuters.
In a 2021 lawsuit,the Justice Department allegedthat the law disproportionately harmed Black voters by limiting absentee ballots and banning the distribution of water or food to people waiting in line at polling places.
Georgia has denied the claims, arguing the law is aimed at securing elections. Brad Raffensperger, a Republican who serves as the state's top elections official, said the Justice Department’s move shows the law “stands on solid legal ground.”
Preliminary data from the 2024 election shows that while the total number of ballots cast by Black voters increased, the turnout gap between white and Black voters grew by about 3% from 2020 to 2024, according to the left-leaning Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law.",https://www.reuters.com/world/us/change-course-us-justice-dept-drops-challenge-georgia-voting-law-2025-03-31/
"Harvard's federal grants, contracts under review over alleged antisemitism, US says","WASHINGTON, March 31 (Reuters) - The Trump administration said on Monday that it was reviewing $9 billion in federal contracts and grants given to Harvard University as part of an ongoing effort to crack down on what it says is antisemitism on college campuses.
The Departments of Education, Health and Human Services and the U.S. General Services Administration said in a written statement that $255.6 million in contracts between Harvard, its affiliates and the federal government were being reviewed, along with $8.7 billion in multi-year grant commitments.
The focus on Harvard comes after the Trump administration this month canceled $400 million in federal funding for fellow Ivy League school Columbia University.
Columbia was the epicenter of anti-Israel protests that broke out on several U.S. college campuses following the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack inside Israel, and Israel's subsequent war in Gaza. The university's interim president announced that she wasstepping downover the weekend.
The Trump administration has blasted universities for not doing enough to combat antisemitism and ensure student safety during the protests.
""Harvard has served as a symbol of the American Dream for generations – the pinnacle aspiration for students all over the world to work hard and earn admission to the storied institution,"" said Secretary of Education Linda McMahon. ""Harvard's failure to protect students on campus from anti-Semitic discrimination - all while promoting divisive ideologies over free inquiry - has put its reputation in serious jeopardy.""

US Supreme Court leans toward Catholic group's bid for Wisconsin unemployment tax exemption,"WASHINGTON, March 31 (Reuters) - TheU.S. Supreme Courtappeared sympathetic on Monday toward a bid by an arm of a Catholic diocese in Wisconsin for areligious exemptionfrom the state's unemployment insurance tax in the latest religious rights case to reach the justices.
They heard arguments in an appeal by the Catholic Charities Bureau - a nonprofit corporation operating as the social ministry arm of the Catholic diocese in the city of Superior - and four entities that the bureau oversees of a lower court's decision rejecting their tax exemption bid.
At issue was whether Wisconsin's denial of the tax exemption violated the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment guarantee of free exercise of religion, as well as its separation of church and state. Under Wisconsin's unemployment insurance program, the state collects taxes from employers and uses the revenue to provide a temporary source of income to eligible jobless workers.
Lawyer Eric Rassbach, arguing for the Catholic Charities Bureau, urged the justices to embrace a ""generous approach to exemptions, not a stingy one."" A lawyer for PresidentDonald Trump's administration also argued in support of the challengers.
Wisconsin Assistant Attorney General Colin Roth told the justices that expanding the exemption as the plaintiffs seek could threaten jobless benefits for numerous currently covered employees nationwide who work for religiously affiliated employers.
""It would leave potentially over one million employees nationwide without unemployment coverage, like nurses and janitors at religiously affiliated hospitals,"" Roth said.
The federal government and all states exempt certain religious entities from having to pay into unemployment insurance programs. Most of these laws, including Wisconsin's, require that organizations be ""operated primarily for religious purposes"" to be eligible for a religious exemption.
The Wisconsin Supreme Court in 2024 rejected the tax exemption bid by Catholic Charities Bureau and its subsidiaries. Although the groups ""assert a religious motivation behind their work,"" that court found, their activities were ""primarily charitable and secular"" and thus were not ""operated primarily for religious purposes.""
The Catholic Charities Bureau since 1917, it said on its website, has provided ""services to the poor, the disadvantaged, the disabled, the elderly and children with special needs as an expression of the social ministry of the Catholic Church in the Diocese of Superior.""
Roth said Wisconsin's law is meant to prevent state officials who are handling unemployment disputes from having to involve the government in questions of religious doctrine. Some of the justices pressed Roth on whether that policy would benefit religious denominations and groups that proselytize and seek to inculcate their religion over those that do not.
""Isn't it a fundamental premise of our First Amendment that the state shouldn't be picking and choosing between religions?"" asked conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch.
""I thought it was pretty fundamental that we don't treat some religions better than other religions, and we certainly don't do it based on the content of the religious doctrine that those religions preach,"" liberal Justice Elena Kagan told Roth.
The Catholic Charities Bureau and its subsidiaries do not require their employees to be of any particular religion, nor do they seek to instill Catholic beliefs in those receiving their services. Among the subsidiary groups involved in the case are organizations that provide services to people with disabilities including job placements and training, as well as daily living services and home visitation, according to court papers.
During the Great Depression, Wisconsin in 1932 became the first U.S. state to enact an unemployment compensation law.
Three years later, Democratic U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt signed into law the landmark Social Security Act of 1935 that established, among other programs, a cooperative federal-state unemployment insurance plan that would eventually lead to all U.S. states enacting their own unemployment relief programs.
Some of the justices raised questions about the consequences of expanding the exemption, including whether a vegetarian restaurant owned by a religiously affiliated employer that does not believe in eating meat would get an exemption, and how the law would apply to religiously affiliated hospitals.
""There are lots of hard questions in this area - vegan restaurants, hospitals - lots of hard questions,"" Kagan said.
A ruling in the case is expected by the end of June.
The Supreme Court, with its 6-3 conservative majority, has taken an expansive view of religious rights in a series of rulings in recent years. The court on April 30 is due to hear another case involving Catholic interests in abidled by two Catholic dioceses to establish in Oklahoma the nation's first taxpayer-funded religious charter school in a case testing the separation of church and state.",https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-supreme-court-hear-catholic-groups-bid-wisconsin-unemployment-tax-exemption-2025-03-31/

"Democratic senators urge Trump to revamp China trade ties, revise free trade deals","WASHINGTON, March 31 (Reuters) - Three Democratic senators on Monday urged U.S. PresidentDonald Trumpto ""dramatically revise"" the United States' trade relationship with China along with 14 free trade agreements, providing a boost to his push to revamp U.S. trade policy.
In a letter to the Republican president, Senators Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and Gary Peters and Elissa Slotkin of Michigan welcomed the comprehensive review of trade policy Trump has ordered and his push to rebuild the U.S. manufacturing base.
Trump has upended U.S. trade policy and unsettled financial markets with a series oftariffsaimed at competitors like China and neighbors like Canada and Mexico and specific sectors like autos and metals. He plans to announce more tariffs aimed atall countrieswith big trade surpluses on Wednesday.
The policies have sparked criticism from free trade groups and some firms, but also support from unions and some Democratic lawmakers, underscoring the bipartisan nature of concerns over the loss of 4.3 million manufacturing jobs since 2001.
The Democratic senators said changes were urgently needed after what they called flawed trade decisions made by Democrats and Republicans on trade ties with China and other countries, while calling on Trump to keep the needs of workers in mind.
""Free trade and globalization have left us with offshored manufacturing, devastated communities, workers out of a job or in jobs with lower wages, and supply chains overly dependent on our adversaries in too many areas,"" they wrote, noting that their states had suffered disproportionately.
The senators urged Trump to focus on a ""pro-American worker trade policy"" by rethinking a 2000 decision to grant China permanent normal trade relations status, which paved the way for its entry into the World Trade Organization.
The Trump administration should also rethink its 14 free trade deals with 20 countries, including the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement and take steps to strengthen trade enforcement mechanisms, including through ending a trade rule called ""de minimis"" that allows goods valued at less than $800 to enter the country duty-free and with minimal inspections.
Trump ordered the end of the loophole,which allowed nearly 1.4 billion packages to enter the U.S. last year, but quickly paused it due to logistical issues.
The senators said they viewed Trump's favored instrument of tariffs as an important tool for leveling the playing field, but noted that it could take years to impact supply chains.
To ensure the tariffs worked, the administration also needed to make investments, enact Buy America requirements and tax incentives, like those in the Inflation Reduction Act passed under former President Joe Biden that Trump has vowed to undo.
Steps were also needed to keep corporations in check with equitable tax rates and strong antitrust laws, and empowering workers to join unions, they said.",https://www.reuters.com/world/us/democratic-senators-urge-trump-revamp-china-trade-ties-revise-free-trade-deals-2025-03-31/
Musk gives away two $1 million checks to Wisconsin voters in high profile judicial race,"March 30 (Reuters) - BillionaireElon Muskon Sunday handed out million-dollar checks to two voters in Wisconsin and promised smaller payments to others who help elect a conservative candidate to the state's top court in a closely watched election.
The Tesla CEO, a top adviser to U.S. PresidentDonald Trump, handed out oversized checks at a rally in Green Bay as he sought to drum up enthusiasm for a state Supreme Court election that is already the most expensive judicial race in U.S. history.
Musk said he would also pay supporters $20 for every voter they recruit over the next two days.
He said he was spending the money to raise awareness of a race in which liberal Susan Crawford seems to be running ahead of conservative Brad Schimel.
""We actually are in serious danger of losing the election,"" he said. ""We've got to pull a rabbit out of a hat.""
The April 1 contest will determine the ideological tilt of the state's top court as it considers abortion rights, labor rights and possibly election rules. Technically nonpartisan, the race is seen as anearly referendum on Trumpin a politically competitive state.
Musk warned the court might redraw legislative districts in a way that could cause Trump's Republicans to lose seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.
""I think this will be important for the future of civilization. It's that significant,"" Musk said.
As of last week, groups affiliated with Musk had spent at least $17.5 million to support Schimel, according to New York University's Brennan Center for Justice -- more than one-fifth of the $81 million spent in total on the race.
Musk's $1 million giveaway echoed his tactics from the 2024 presidential election, when he gave checks to voters who signed petitions supporting conservative causes.
Wisconsin's attorney general, Democrat Josh Kaul, sued to block the giveaway but the state supreme court ruled it could go ahead, according to the Washington Post.
Musk spent more than $250 million to help elect Trump last year, far more than any other individual, and his appearance in Wisconsin showed his willingness to get involved in downballot races as well.
Trump has deputized Musk to oversee an unprecedented effort to slash the federal government that has effectively shuttered several agencies and fired tens of thousands of workers.",https://www.reuters.com/world/us/musk-gives-away-two-1-million-checks-wisconsin-voters-high-profile-judicial-race-2025-03-31/

All of Trump’s tariffs and threatened trade actions,"March 31 (Reuters) - U.S. President DonaldTrumphas made numerous tariff threats since returning to office on January 20, ranging from a universal duty on imports to targeted tariffs on specific sectors or countries, in a bid to get others to meet his policy demands.
Trump's threats have changed over time, leaving other nations and businesses unclear about what is to come next and creating uncertainty for consumers, triggering a recent stock market selloff.
Here is a roundup of Trump's trade-related steps and threats.
A cornerstone of Trump's vision includes a phased rollout of universal tariffs on all U.S. imports.
Last month, Trump tasked his economics team with devising plans forreciprocal tariffson every country that taxes U.S. imports, as well as to counteract non-tariff barriers such as vehicle safety rules that exclude U.S. autos, and value-added taxes that increase their cost.
On March 30, Trump said he was planning to unveil amassive tariff plan, which he has called ""Liberation Day."" The reciprocal tariffs he is set to announce will include all nations.
Global trading partners' potential counter-tariffs targeting U.S. agricultural, energy and machinery exports could escalate into a worldwidetrade war, creating uncertainty for businesses and investors.
Trump's tariff proposals target several key trade partners; some are listed below.
MEXICO AND CANADA: The two countries were the largest trade partners of the U.S. in 2024 through November, with Mexico ranked first. Trump's new 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada took effect on March 4 as a retaliation for migration and fentanyl trafficking.
The tariffs included a 25% levy on most goods from Mexico and Canada, along with a 10% duty on energy imports from Canada. Canada primarily exports crude oil and other energy goods, as well as cars and auto parts within the North American auto manufacturing chain. Mexico also exports various goods to the U.S. in the industrial and auto sectors.
Canada hit back with 25% tariffs on C$30 billion ($20.7 billion) worth ofU.S. imports, including orange juice, peanut butter, beer, coffee, appliances and motorcycles.
The Canadian government added that it would impose additional tariffs on C$125 billion of U.S. goods if Trump's tariffs were still in place in 21 days, with the potential inclusion of vehicles, steel, aircraft, beef and pork.
Trump, in his March 4 address to Congress, said further tariffs would follow on April 2, including ""reciprocal tariffs"" and non-tariff actions to address trade imbalances.
U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said U.S. officials might still work out a partial resolution with the two neighbors, adding that they needed to do more on the fentanyl front.
Trump on March 11walked backplanned 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum products from Canada, after a Canadian official withdrewplans for a 25% surchargeon electricity exports to the United States.
On March 12, Canada, the biggest foreign supplier of steel and aluminum to the United States, said it wouldimpose retaliatory tariffson U.S. imported goods worth C$29.8 billion ($20 billion) in response to Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs.
CHINA: Trump levied 10% tariffs across all Chinese imports into the U.S., effective on February 4, following repeated warnings to Beijing about insufficient measures to halt the flow of illicit drugs into the United States.
He followed that up with another 10% duty on Chinese goods, effective March 4, stacking on top of tariffs of up to 25% imposed on Chinese imports during Trump's first term.
China responded by announcingadditional tariffsof 10% to 15% on certain U.S. imports from March 10 and a series of new export restrictions for designated U.S. entities. Later it raised complaints about the U.S. tariffs with the World Trade Organization.
China said on March 12 that it would takeall necessary measuresto safeguard its rights and interests, after U.S. President Donald Trump increased tariffs on all U.S. steel and aluminum imports.
EUROPE: Trump said theEU and other countrieshave troubling trade surpluses with the United States. He has said the countries' products will either be subject to tariffs or he will demand they buy more oil and gas from the U.S., even though U.S. gas export capacity is near its limits.
The European Commission said in a statement on February 14 that it viewed the ""reciprocal"" trade policy as a step in the wrong direction.
Trump has threatened a 25% ""reciprocal"" rate on European goods. Among vulnerable industries is pharmaceuticals, as U.S. firms such as Johnson & Johnson(JNJ.N), opens new taband Pfizer(PFE.N), opens new tabhave large plants in Ireland, which is also a major exporter of medical devices.
The European Union on March 12 said it wouldimpose counter-tariffson 26 billion euros ($28 billion) worth of U.S. goods from next month, in response to blanket U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum.
On March 13, Trump threatened to slap a200% tariff on European wine and spiritsin response to the EU plan to impose tariffs on American whiskey and other products next month.
AUTOS: On March 26, Trump unveiled a 25% tariff onimported cars and light trucks. The 25% levy would be imposed on top of previous duties on imports of finished vehicles starting on April 3.
Trump's directive included temporary exemptions for auto parts that are compliant with the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) on trade that Trump negotiated during his first term.
Other major automotive parts imports, identified in Trump's proclamation as ""engines and engine parts, transmissions and powertrain parts, and electrical components,"" will be subject to the tariffs on a date to be specified in a Federal Register notice, ""but no later than May 3, 2025.""
METALS: On March 12, Trump increased tariffs onall steel and aluminumimports to 25%, and extended the duties to hundreds of downstream products, from nuts and bolts to bulldozer blades and soda cans.
The U.S. is the world's largest aluminum importer and the second-largest steel importer, with more than half of those volumes coming from Canada, Mexico and Brazil.
Trump on February 25 ordered a new probe into possible new tariffs oncopper importsto rebuild U.S. production of the metal critical in electric vehicles, military hardware, semiconductors and a wide range of consumer goods.
The U.S. produces domestically just over half the refinedcopperit consumes each year.
SEMICONDUCTORS: Trump said tariffs on semiconductor chips would also start at ""25%, or higher,"" rising substantially over the course of a year, but didn't clarify when these will come into effect.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co(2330.TW), opens new tab, the world's largest contract chipmaker, makes semiconductors for Nvidia, Apple and other U.S. clients, and generated 70% of its revenue in 2024 from customers based in North America.
LUMBER: Trump on March 1 ordered a new trade investigation that could heap moretariffs on imported lumber, adding to existing duties on Canadian softwood lumber and 25% tariffs on all Canadian and Mexican goods.
ALCOHOL: Trump on March 13 threatened to slapa 200% tariffon wine, cognac and other alcohol imports from Europe, in response to a European Union plan to impose tariffs on American whiskey and other products next month — which itself is a retaliation to Trump's 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports that took effect the day before.",https://www.reuters.com/world/us/all-donald-trumps-tariff-threats-2025-01-28/
