"Trump plans executive order targeting ticket scalping, according to document","WASHINGTON, March 31 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Monday planned to sign an executive order aimed at protecting fans from ""exploitative ticket scalping"" and reforming the U.S. live entertainment ticketing industry, according to a White House fact sheet seen by Reuters.
The order directs Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi to ensure that ticket scalpers are in full compliance with the tax-collecting Internal Revenue Service and other applicable law, the fact sheet said.
The order directs the Federal Trade Commission to work with the U.S. attorney to ensure that competition laws are appropriately enforced in the concert and entertainment industry, it said.
In January, U.S. senatorsassailedLive Nation Entertainment's lack of transparency and inability to block bot purchases of tickets, in a hearing called after a major fiasco involving ticket sales for a Taylor Swift concert tour.
Live Nation Entertainment Inc's subsidiary Ticketmaster, which has been unpopular with fans for years, has drawn fresh heat from U.S. lawmakers over how it handled ticket sales last fall for Swift's ""Eras"" tour, her first in five years.
Experts say Ticketmaster commands more than a 70% market share of primary ticket services for major U.S. concert venues.
The fact sheet singled out bot sales in particular.
""Ticket scalpers use bots and other unfair means to acquire large quantities of face-value tickets, then re-sell them at an enormous markup on the secondary market, price-gouging consumers and depriving fans of the opportunity to see their favorite artists without incurring extraordinary expenses,"" it said.",https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-plans-executive-order-targeting-ticket-scalping-according-document-2025-03-31/
Explainer: Can Donald Trump serve a third term as US president?,"March 31 (Reuters) - PresidentDonald Trumpsaid on Sunday he wasnot jokingabout seeking a third term but did not explain how he would get around the U.S. Constitution's prohibition against anyone serving more than two terms as president.
Here is a look at the legal barriers Trump faces.
The 22nd Amendment states in part: “No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.”
The amendment was ratified in 1951 after President Franklin D. Roosevelt broke with a self-imposed two-termlimit set by presidentssince George Washington, the nation’s first.
Roosevelt, a Democrat who was president during the Great Depression and World War Two, served a third term and then died months into his fourth term in 1945.
Yes, but that is highly unlikely in an era of intense political polarization between Democrats and Trump’s Republican Party.
Any constitutional amendment would require two-thirds support in the House and Senate or a convention called by two-thirds of the states, and then ratification by 38 of the 50 state legislatures.
Republicans hold a razor-thin 218-213 majority in the House and a 53-47 majority in the Senate. Republicans control 28 state legislatures.
Andy Ogles, a Republican U.S. representative from Tennessee and a strong Trump supporter, in January proposed amending the 22nd Amendment to allow people to serve three non-consecutive terms as president.
Since Trump's terms beginning in 2017 and in 2025 were non-consecutive, the amendment if passed would allow him to serve a third term starting in 2029.
In an interview with NBC, Trump said one possibility would be for his vice president, J.D. Vance, to run for president in 2028 with Trump as his vice presidential candidate.
Vance would then resign as president if he wins, paving the way for Trump to return to the White House.
But Trump is barred from running for vice president because he is not eligible to be president. The 12th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution reads, ""No person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States.""",https://www.reuters.com/world/us/can-donald-trump-serve-third-term-us-president-2025-03-31/
US Supreme Court leans toward Catholic group's bid for Wisconsin unemployment tax exemption,"WASHINGTON, March 31 (Reuters) - TheU.S. Supreme Courtappeared sympathetic on Monday toward a bid by an arm of a Catholic diocese in Wisconsin for areligious exemptionfrom the state's unemployment insurance tax in the latest religious rights case to reach the justices.
They heard arguments in an appeal by the Catholic Charities Bureau - a nonprofit corporation operating as the social ministry arm of the Catholic diocese in the city of Superior - and four entities that the bureau oversees of a lower court's decision rejecting their tax exemption bid.
At issue was whether Wisconsin's denial of the tax exemption violated the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment guarantee of free exercise of religion, as well as its separation of church and state. Under Wisconsin's unemployment insurance program, the state collects taxes from employers and uses the revenue to provide a temporary source of income to eligible jobless workers.
Lawyer Eric Rassbach, arguing for the Catholic Charities Bureau, urged the justices to embrace a ""generous approach to exemptions, not a stingy one."" A lawyer for PresidentDonald Trump's administration also argued in support of the challengers.
Wisconsin Assistant Attorney General Colin Roth told the justices that expanding the exemption as the plaintiffs seek could threaten jobless benefits for numerous currently covered employees nationwide who work for religiously affiliated employers.
""It would leave potentially over one million employees nationwide without unemployment coverage, like nurses and janitors at religiously affiliated hospitals,"" Roth said.
The federal government and all states exempt certain religious entities from having to pay into unemployment insurance programs. Most of these laws, including Wisconsin's, require that organizations be ""operated primarily for religious purposes"" to be eligible for a religious exemption.
The Wisconsin Supreme Court in 2024 rejected the tax exemption bid by Catholic Charities Bureau and its subsidiaries. Although the groups ""assert a religious motivation behind their work,"" that court found, their activities were ""primarily charitable and secular"" and thus were not ""operated primarily for religious purposes.""
The Catholic Charities Bureau since 1917, it said on its website, has provided ""services to the poor, the disadvantaged, the disabled, the elderly and children with special needs as an expression of the social ministry of the Catholic Church in the Diocese of Superior.""
Roth said Wisconsin's law is meant to prevent state officials who are handling unemployment disputes from having to involve the government in questions of religious doctrine. Some of the justices pressed Roth on whether that policy would benefit religious denominations and groups that proselytize and seek to inculcate their religion over those that do not.
""Isn't it a fundamental premise of our First Amendment that the state shouldn't be picking and choosing between religions?"" asked conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch.
""I thought it was pretty fundamental that we don't treat some religions better than other religions, and we certainly don't do it based on the content of the religious doctrine that those religions preach,"" liberal Justice Elena Kagan told Roth.
The Catholic Charities Bureau and its subsidiaries do not require their employees to be of any particular religion, nor do they seek to instill Catholic beliefs in those receiving their services. Among the subsidiary groups involved in the case are organizations that provide services to people with disabilities including job placements and training, as well as daily living services and home visitation, according to court papers.
During the Great Depression, Wisconsin in 1932 became the first U.S. state to enact an unemployment compensation law.
Three years later, Democratic U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt signed into law the landmark Social Security Act of 1935 that established, among other programs, a cooperative federal-state unemployment insurance plan that would eventually lead to all U.S. states enacting their own unemployment relief programs.
Some of the justices raised questions about the consequences of expanding the exemption, including whether a vegetarian restaurant owned by a religiously affiliated employer that does not believe in eating meat would get an exemption, and how the law would apply to religiously affiliated hospitals.
""There are lots of hard questions in this area - vegan restaurants, hospitals - lots of hard questions,"" Kagan said.
A ruling in the case is expected by the end of June.
The Supreme Court, with its 6-3 conservative majority, has taken an expansive view of religious rights in a series of rulings in recent years. The court on April 30 is due to hear another case involving Catholic interests in abidled by two Catholic dioceses to establish in Oklahoma the nation's first taxpayer-funded religious charter school in a case testing the separation of church and state.",https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-supreme-court-hear-catholic-groups-bid-wisconsin-unemployment-tax-exemption-2025-03-31/
Musk gives away two $1 million checks to Wisconsin voters in high profile judicial race,"March 30 (Reuters) - BillionaireElon Muskon Sunday handed out million-dollar checks to two voters in Wisconsin and promised smaller payments to others who help elect a conservative candidate to the state's top court in a closely watched election.
The Tesla CEO, a top adviser to U.S. PresidentDonald Trump, handed out oversized checks at a rally in Green Bay as he sought to drum up enthusiasm for a state Supreme Court election that is already the most expensive judicial race in U.S. history.
Musk said he would also pay supporters $20 for every voter they recruit over the next two days.
He said he was spending the money to raise awareness of a race in which liberal Susan Crawford seems to be running ahead of conservative Brad Schimel.
""We actually are in serious danger of losing the election,"" he said. ""We've got to pull a rabbit out of a hat.""
The April 1 contest will determine the ideological tilt of the state's top court as it considers abortion rights, labor rights and possibly election rules. Technically nonpartisan, the race is seen as anearly referendum on Trumpin a politically competitive state.
Musk warned the court might redraw legislative districts in a way that could cause Trump's Republicans to lose seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.
""I think this will be important for the future of civilization. It's that significant,"" Musk said.
As of last week, groups affiliated with Musk had spent at least $17.5 million to support Schimel, according to New York University's Brennan Center for Justice -- more than one-fifth of the $81 million spent in total on the race.
Musk's $1 million giveaway echoed his tactics from the 2024 presidential election, when he gave checks to voters who signed petitions supporting conservative causes.
Wisconsin's attorney general, Democrat Josh Kaul, sued to block the giveaway but the state supreme court ruled it could go ahead, according to the Washington Post.
Musk spent more than $250 million to help elect Trump last year, far more than any other individual, and his appearance in Wisconsin showed his willingness to get involved in downballot races as well.
Trump has deputized Musk to oversee an unprecedented effort to slash the federal government that has effectively shuttered several agencies and fired tens of thousands of workers.",https://www.reuters.com/world/us/musk-gives-away-two-1-million-checks-wisconsin-voters-high-profile-judicial-race-2025-03-31/
Insight: How the Trump family took over a crypto firm as it raised hundreds of millions,"LONDON/NEW YORK, March 31 (Reuters) - As World Liberty Financial raised more than half a billion dollars, President Donald Trump’s family took control of the crypto venture and grabbed the lion’s share of those funds, aided by governance terms that industry experts say favor insiders.
Launched last fall, World Liberty’s goal is to allow people to access financial services using cryptocurrencies and without intermediaries like banks in what is called decentralized finance, or DeFi. But it has yet to launch a public platform and has reported only a small staff, a review of the project shows.
Even so, World Liberty said in mid-March it had raised $550 million selling so-called governance tokens. Most of those sales took place after Trump’s election win in November, Reuters calculations show.
The tokens, which go by the symbol $WLFI, give holders the right to vote on changes to the project’s underlying code and to signal their opinion on its direction and plans. They cannot be traded.
As its fundraising got traction, World Liberty disclosed in January that the Trump family had taken control of the business, a review of changes in the fine print on World Liberty’s website shows. Two of its co-founders, crypto entrepreneurs Zak Folkman and Chase Herro, were replaced as the controlling parties of World Liberty by an entity in which the Trump family holds a 60% stake.
The changes have not been previously reported.
Overall, the Trump family now has a claim on 75% of net revenues from token sales and 60% from World Liberty operations once the core business gets going. The arrangement means the Trump family is currently entitled to about $400 million in fees. After World Liberty's co-founders take their cut, the crypto venture will be left with 5% of the $550 million raised to date to build the platform, according to Reuters calculations.
The arrangements, including the Trump family’s large share of the project’s revenues and the non-tradeable nature of the governance tokens, make World Liberty unusually centralized for the industry, according to a survey of the practices of the five largest DeFi lending platforms and interviews with four U.S. academics who study the crypto industry.
""It's hard for me to see any economic benefit to the owner of these tokens,"" said Jim Angel, an associate professor at Georgetown University who has written about DeFi regulation.
David Krause, a longtime finance professor at Marquette University in Milwaukee who recently published a study of World Liberty, said that the structure of the project “pretty much excludes public investors or token holders from any meaningful financial participation.”
A White House spokesperson referred questions about World Liberty to the Trump Organization. The Trump Organization's chief legal officer and the president's two older sons, who are executives at the company, did not respond to requests for comment.
The Trump Organization announced in January that the president's investments, assets and business interests would be held in a trust managed by his children and he would play no role in day-to-day operations or decision-making. The family's business also retained an attorney to serve as an ethics adviser to ""avoid any perceived conflicts of interest.""
Folkman and Herro did not reply to Reuters questions in person and in writing. In a post on social media platform X on March 14, World Liberty said it “is a DeFi project with a tremendous mission to build and democratize a new financial system for the benefit of millions.”
At a conference in February, Herro said the plan was to open crypto investing to everyday Americans such as teachers, dentists and firemen. His business partner, Donald Trump Jr, the president's son, has complained about the family being excluded from traditional banking in the aftermath of his father's first term.
The Trump family’s investment in World Liberty ties the personal fortunes of a sitting U.S. president to an asset class that sits at the outer edges of both risk and regulation.
Trump has promised to be the “crypto president,” who will popularize its mainstream use in America. He has said he backs crypto because it can improve the banking system and increase the dominance of the U.S. dollar.
At the same time, the Trump family, long rooted in skyscrapers and country clubs, has opened beachheads in crypto, quickly gaining hundreds of millions of dollars. A so-called meme coin promoted by Trump has generated at least $349 million in fees for entities connected to the president, according to crypto data firm Chainalysis.
On Monday, the Trump family deepened its crypto interests, as a company formed with the president's elder sons, Eric and Donald Trump Jr., took a minority stake in a newly-formed bitcoin producer called American Bitcoin. Eric Trump will become the chief strategy officer of the new firm, which will focus on mining bitcoin and aims to become publicly listed, the statement said.
The prospect of Trump and his family benefiting from deregulation has drawn criticism from hispolitical opponentsand some government ethics experts who say it creates the potential for conflicts of interest and influence peddling.
""You've got the guy in charge who is responsible for his own regulation,"" said Ross Delston, a former U.S. banking regulator who has acted as an expert witness on anti-money laundering issues for the government.
Delston also pointed to the potential for people buying $WLFI tokens to earn political favor. It would be “the perfect vehicle,” he said, for governments or oligarchs overseas “to funnel money to the president.""
World Liberty has attracted well-heeled buyers: Almost 70% of the money raised came from wallets that spent at least $100,000, and more than 50% was buys of $1 million or more, according to a Reuters analysis of publicly available information on transactions.
While buyers of $WLFI gave their names to the venture, the identity of nearly all of those big spenders is hidden from public view by anonymous crypto wallets. Among ahandful of buyers that Reuters was able to identify,several said they bought into the token because they believed Trump’s involvement would help it succeed as a business.
World Liberty’s beginnings lie in the convergence of two obscure figures on the crypto scene and some of the most powerful people in American politics.
Folkman and Herro entered Trump circles via the family of New York real estate mogul Steve Witkoff, a longtime Trump friend who is now also his envoy to the Mideast.
The two crypto entrepreneurs had already collaborated on several companies together focused on making money from online ventures. Their business background includes past instances of dissolution, litigation and unpaid debts, according to corporate records, state filings and U.S. court documents. Early in his career, Folkman offered seminars on how to “date hotter girls.”
Steve Witkoff said he was introduced to the pair by one of his sons, when speaking about how the deal came together on a crypto podcast hosted in September by the Trump family.
After meeting the two crypto businessmen and hearing them speak about the difficulties of getting credit in traditional finance, Witkoff said he thought of the Trumps. He set up a meeting with Donald Trump and his two oldest sons for Herro and Folkman to describe the opportunities of DeFi. The Trumps, Witkoff said, were smitten: “We said, ‘Let’s go pursue it.’”
Witkoff did not respond to requests for comment.
Despite Trump’s backing, token sales were slow at first. According to a U.S. regulatory filing by the company dated October 30 - around two weeks after World Liberty sales had begun - the venture’s total amount sold was only $2.7 million.
Then, on November 25, less than three weeks after Trump won the U.S. election, Justin Sun, a Hong Kong-based crypto entrepreneur who was fighting a U.S. securities fraud lawsuit, announced that he’d sunk $30 million into $WLFI - the amount the company said it needed to jumpstart operations.
“His amount was pretty meaningful at that point,” said “Ogle”, a World Liberty security adviser who only goes by that pseudonym and has appeared in video interviews with his face obscured by a bandana and sunglasses.
Sun has said his investment has since risen to $75 million. As well as its single-largest known investor, he has become an advisor to the project. Meanwhile, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in February paused its case against him, citing public interest.
Sun didn’t respond to a request for comment. The SEC declined to comment.
Initially, Herro and Folkman were listed as the “sole directors and members” of World Liberty Financial Inc, the main entity developing the platform, according to World Liberty’s terms and conditions, last updated in October.
On January 19 and 20 - the day of Trump’s inauguration - World Liberty raised almost $300 million in a frenzy of token sales, according to a Reuters analysis of blockchain data. Around that time, its website was updated to say WLF Holdco LLC now controlled World Liberty Financial Inc. And DT Marks DeFi LLC – Trump’s company – now held about 60% of WLF Holdco. It did not disclose who owns the rest.
The president’s son, Eric, also gained a seat on WLF Holdco’s board of managers.
Reuters could not ascertain the terms of any deals between Trump and his partners that led to the changes.
Angel, the Georgetown professor, said the corporate structure had put several layers of entities between Trump and World Liberty, protecting the president from any potential legal action should something go wrong. “He can say: ‘You can't sue me because I'm not involved’,” Angel said.
The five largest DeFi lending platforms, as ranked by data site DefiLlama, all have governance tokens that give holders voting rights. But unlike World Liberty, those five platforms either allocated the majority of their governance tokens to be given away for free to users, sold them to venture capitalists in return for money to build the platform, or paid them to partners in return for building the project.
World Liberty governance tokens lack another critical feature of those issued by other DeFi platforms – the ability of token holders to vote for the platform to pay them a share of its profits. World Liberty has told token holders any vote to breach its existing deals with Trump and other backers would have no force, according to a 13-page description of the business released in October.
Folkman told a New York audience on March 18 that the company is working on three main products, including a “lend and borrow” market that would be announced soon and a personal finance application. World Liberty also said in March that it is planning tolaunch a stablecoin, known as USD1, that will be backed by assets such as U.S. Treasuries and redeemable for a dollar.
One company that World Liberty has collaborated with is Ondo Finance. The startup, founded in 2021 by former Goldman Sachs employees, lets users buy blockchain-based tokens backed by U.S. Treasuries and other assets such as money market funds, thereby earning interest. The two companies said in a statement that they would collaborate to “advance the adoption of tokenized real-world assets.”
“They're all in early stages, but we're exploring what they're doing at a very high level,” Nathan Allman, Ondo’s CEO, told Reuters.
While World Liberty has also used some of the money it raisedto invest in other cryptocurrencies, it has yet to launch a DeFi platform.
Two software developers listed on World Liberty's website are based in Romania, according to their social media profiles. Octavian Lojnita was previously a developer at Dough Finance, a Herro and Folkman project that collapsed last year after being hacked, according to Lojnita's online profile and the publicly available source code of Dough. The online handle for a second developer at Dough matches that of Bogdan Purnavel, also at World Liberty.
Lojnita declined to discuss his involvement in World Liberty. Purnavel referred questions to World Liberty.
The coding for contracts posted to the project’s blockchain – a public-facing database – shows that World Liberty “appears to still be in development, with several functionalities not yet implemented or fully operational,” according to a review in late March by CertiK, a cybersecurity company that audits projects for security flaws.",https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/how-trump-family-took-over-world-liberty-financial-it-raised-hundreds-millions-2025-03-31/
All of Trump’s tariffs and threatened trade actions,"March 31 (Reuters) - U.S. President DonaldTrumphas made numerous tariff threats since returning to office on January 20, ranging from a universal duty on imports to targeted tariffs on specific sectors or countries, in a bid to get others to meet his policy demands.
Trump's threats have changed over time, leaving other nations and businesses unclear about what is to come next and creating uncertainty for consumers, triggering a recent stock market selloff.
Here is a roundup of Trump's trade-related steps and threats.
A cornerstone of Trump's vision includes a phased rollout of universal tariffs on all U.S. imports.
Last month, Trump tasked his economics team with devising plans forreciprocal tariffson every country that taxes U.S. imports, as well as to counteract non-tariff barriers such as vehicle safety rules that exclude U.S. autos, and value-added taxes that increase their cost.
On March 30, Trump said he was planning to unveil amassive tariff plan, which he has called ""Liberation Day."" The reciprocal tariffs he is set to announce will include all nations.
Global trading partners' potential counter-tariffs targeting U.S. agricultural, energy and machinery exports could escalate into a worldwidetrade war, creating uncertainty for businesses and investors.
Trump's tariff proposals target several key trade partners; some are listed below.
MEXICO AND CANADA: The two countries were the largest trade partners of the U.S. in 2024 through November, with Mexico ranked first. Trump's new 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada took effect on March 4 as a retaliation for migration and fentanyl trafficking.
The tariffs included a 25% levy on most goods from Mexico and Canada, along with a 10% duty on energy imports from Canada. Canada primarily exports crude oil and other energy goods, as well as cars and auto parts within the North American auto manufacturing chain. Mexico also exports various goods to the U.S. in the industrial and auto sectors.
Canada hit back with 25% tariffs on C$30 billion ($20.7 billion) worth ofU.S. imports, including orange juice, peanut butter, beer, coffee, appliances and motorcycles.
The Canadian government added that it would impose additional tariffs on C$125 billion of U.S. goods if Trump's tariffs were still in place in 21 days, with the potential inclusion of vehicles, steel, aircraft, beef and pork.
Trump, in his March 4 address to Congress, said further tariffs would follow on April 2, including ""reciprocal tariffs"" and non-tariff actions to address trade imbalances.
U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said U.S. officials might still work out a partial resolution with the two neighbors, adding that they needed to do more on the fentanyl front.
Trump on March 11walked backplanned 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum products from Canada, after a Canadian official withdrewplans for a 25% surchargeon electricity exports to the United States.
On March 12, Canada, the biggest foreign supplier of steel and aluminum to the United States, said it wouldimpose retaliatory tariffson U.S. imported goods worth C$29.8 billion ($20 billion) in response to Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs.
CHINA: Trump levied 10% tariffs across all Chinese imports into the U.S., effective on February 4, following repeated warnings to Beijing about insufficient measures to halt the flow of illicit drugs into the United States.
He followed that up with another 10% duty on Chinese goods, effective March 4, stacking on top of tariffs of up to 25% imposed on Chinese imports during Trump's first term.
China responded by announcingadditional tariffsof 10% to 15% on certain U.S. imports from March 10 and a series of new export restrictions for designated U.S. entities. Later it raised complaints about the U.S. tariffs with the World Trade Organization.
China said on March 12 that it would takeall necessary measuresto safeguard its rights and interests, after U.S. President Donald Trump increased tariffs on all U.S. steel and aluminum imports.
EUROPE: Trump said theEU and other countrieshave troubling trade surpluses with the United States. He has said the countries' products will either be subject to tariffs or he will demand they buy more oil and gas from the U.S., even though U.S. gas export capacity is near its limits.
The European Commission said in a statement on February 14 that it viewed the ""reciprocal"" trade policy as a step in the wrong direction.
Trump has threatened a 25% ""reciprocal"" rate on European goods. Among vulnerable industries is pharmaceuticals, as U.S. firms such as Johnson & Johnson(JNJ.N), opens new taband Pfizer(PFE.N), opens new tabhave large plants in Ireland, which is also a major exporter of medical devices.
The European Union on March 12 said it wouldimpose counter-tariffson 26 billion euros ($28 billion) worth of U.S. goods from next month, in response to blanket U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum.
On March 13, Trump threatened to slap a200% tariff on European wine and spiritsin response to the EU plan to impose tariffs on American whiskey and other products next month.
AUTOS: On March 26, Trump unveiled a 25% tariff onimported cars and light trucks. The 25% levy would be imposed on top of previous duties on imports of finished vehicles starting on April 3.
Trump's directive included temporary exemptions for auto parts that are compliant with the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) on trade that Trump negotiated during his first term.
Other major automotive parts imports, identified in Trump's proclamation as ""engines and engine parts, transmissions and powertrain parts, and electrical components,"" will be subject to the tariffs on a date to be specified in a Federal Register notice, ""but no later than May 3, 2025.""
METALS: On March 12, Trump increased tariffs onall steel and aluminumimports to 25%, and extended the duties to hundreds of downstream products, from nuts and bolts to bulldozer blades and soda cans.
The U.S. is the world's largest aluminum importer and the second-largest steel importer, with more than half of those volumes coming from Canada, Mexico and Brazil.
Trump on February 25 ordered a new probe into possible new tariffs oncopper importsto rebuild U.S. production of the metal critical in electric vehicles, military hardware, semiconductors and a wide range of consumer goods.
The U.S. produces domestically just over half the refinedcopperit consumes each year.
SEMICONDUCTORS: Trump said tariffs on semiconductor chips would also start at ""25%, or higher,"" rising substantially over the course of a year, but didn't clarify when these will come into effect.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co(2330.TW), opens new tab, the world's largest contract chipmaker, makes semiconductors for Nvidia, Apple and other U.S. clients, and generated 70% of its revenue in 2024 from customers based in North America.
LUMBER: Trump on March 1 ordered a new trade investigation that could heap moretariffs on imported lumber, adding to existing duties on Canadian softwood lumber and 25% tariffs on all Canadian and Mexican goods.
ALCOHOL: Trump on March 13 threatened to slapa 200% tariffon wine, cognac and other alcohol imports from Europe, in response to a European Union plan to impose tariffs on American whiskey and other products next month — which itself is a retaliation to Trump's 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports that took effect the day before.",https://www.reuters.com/world/us/all-donald-trumps-tariff-threats-2025-01-28/
"US agency leading Musk's firing spree to hire new driver, emails show","WASHINGTON, March 31 (Reuters) - The federal human-resources agency leading efforts by billionaire White House adviserElon Muskto slash the federal workforce has decided to hire its first new career employee since PresidentDonald Trumptook office, according to emails seen by Reuters.
The position is a new driver to ferry around leaders of that agency, the Office of Personnel Management, the emails indicate.
OPM's acting director, Chuck Ezell, last week authorized an exemption to a government-wide hiring freeze to replace one of two drivers for agency leadership after one retired in mid-March, according to the messages.
The decision, not previously reported, shows thatMusk's Department of Government Efficiency, which is directing the cuts, is not making the government more effective, said Kathleen Clark, a professor of ethics at Washington University in St. Louis.
""It is becoming increasingly obvious that Musk’s & DOGE’s mission has absolutely nothing to do with efficiency, and instead is aimed at enabling Musk to use - and abuse - power within the federal government,"" she said.
""Authorizing a Musk-controlled agency like OPM to hire a driver while slashing essential federal workers who actually help Americans in need is a good example.""
The White House, DOGE, Musk and Ezell did not respond to requests for comment. An OPM spokesperson said in a statement that the agency ""has ongoing security concerns"" requiring a driver, without providing further detail. Ezell said he hasreceived death threats, opens new tabin the role in an interview last month with byFaith, which describes itself as the Magazine of the Presbyterian Church in America.
One of Trump's first acts as president was to create DOGE, to root out waste, fraud and abuse, slash government spending and purge the federal workforce of low-performing, disloyal and unnecessary workers.
Trump has said he is ""very proud"" of what he describes as a vital initiative to turn off the spigot of wasteful spending.
In practice, some sayDOGE has mostly pursued long-time Republican policy objectives, shuttering agencies such as USAID and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which provide a lifeline to the world's needy and protect Americans from unscrupulous lender respectively.
It has also announced drastic cuts at departments that provide critical social services including the Department of Veterans Affairs, which administers healthcare for veterans, and the Social Security Administration, which sends out checks to retired, disabled and widowed Americans.
OPM, which has led the charge on federal government firings, has laid off more than 200 of its own employees and allowed over 400 to opt in to voluntary exit programs since Trump took office, two people familiar with the matter said.",https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-agency-leading-musks-firing-spree-hire-new-driver-emails-show-2025-03-31/
"Harvard's federal grants, contracts under review over alleged antisemitism, US says","WASHINGTON, March 31 (Reuters) - The Trump administration said on Monday that it was reviewing $9 billion in federal contracts and grants given to Harvard University as part of an ongoing effort to crack down on what it says is antisemitism on college campuses.
The Departments of Education, Health and Human Services and the U.S. General Services Administration said in a written statement that $255.6 million in contracts between Harvard, its affiliates and the federal government were being reviewed, along with $8.7 billion in multi-year grant commitments.
The focus on Harvard comes after the Trump administration this month canceled $400 million in federal funding for fellow Ivy League school Columbia University.
Columbia was the epicenter of anti-Israel protests that broke out on several U.S. college campuses following the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack inside Israel, and Israel's subsequent war in Gaza. The university's interim president announced that she wasstepping downover the weekend.
The Trump administration has blasted universities for not doing enough to combat antisemitism and ensure student safety during the protests.
""Harvard has served as a symbol of the American Dream for generations – the pinnacle aspiration for students all over the world to work hard and earn admission to the storied institution,"" said Secretary of Education Linda McMahon.

"In a change of course, US Justice Dept drops challenge to Georgia voting law","WASHINGTON, March 31 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's Justice Department said on Monday it was pulling out of a lawsuit that challenges a Republican-backed Georgia election law as discriminatory, abandoning a position it took under Democratic President Joe Biden.
U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said recent increases in Black voter turnout in the battleground state refuted the lawsuit's claim that the 2021 law, whichmandated new voting requirements, amounted to voter suppression.
""Georgians deserve secure elections, not fabricated claims of false voter suppression meant to divide us,"" Bondi said in a statement.
The move was the latest in aseries of actionsby the Justice Department to end Biden-era civil rights actions andshift the focusof the Civil Rights Division to pursue conservative causes.
The law is also being challenged by several civil rights groups including the Georgia chapter of the NAACP, which said it would continue its effort.
""When the government drops the ball and turns a blind eye to injustice, we will step in,"" Gerald Griggs, the president of the Georgia NAACP chapter, told Reuters.
In a 2021 lawsuit,the Justice Department allegedthat the law disproportionately harmed Black voters by limiting absentee ballots and banning the distribution of water or food to people waiting in line at polling places.
Georgia has denied the claims, arguing the law is aimed at securing elections. Brad Raffensperger, a Republican who serves as the state's top elections official, said the Justice Department’s move shows the law “stands on solid legal ground.”
Preliminary data from the 2024 election shows that while the total number of ballots cast by Black voters increased, the turnout gap between white and Black voters grew by about 3% from 2020 to 2024, according to the left-leaning Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law.",https://www.reuters.com/world/us/change-course-us-justice-dept-drops-challenge-georgia-voting-law-2025-03-31/
Union sues to block Trump from ending collective bargaining for many federal workers,"March 31 (Reuters) - A union that represents 150,000 U.S. government employees filed a lawsuit on Monday seeking to block PresidentDonald Trumpfrom stripping hundreds of thousands of federal workers of the ability to collectively bargain with government agencies through their unions.
The National Treasury Employees Union said in the lawsuit filed in Washington, D.C. federal court that Trump'sexecutive order, opens new tablast week exempting more than a dozen agencies from collective bargaining obligations violates federal workers' labor rights and the U.S. Constitution and threatens the union's very existence.
The NTEU said the order applies to more than 100,000 of its 158,000 members and would require agencies to stop deducting union dues from those workers' paychecks, a major blow to the union's revenue and bargaining power.
""The strength and influence of any union correlate directly with the size of its membership,"" the NTEU said.
The NTEU said Trump issued the order to punish unions that have challenged many of his efforts to purge the federal workforce. The union has filed lawsuits over the mass firings of recently-hired federal employees, the shuttering of the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and an attempt to make it easier to fireworkers in policy-related jobs.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
On the same day Trump issued the executive order, eight federal agenciesfiled a lawsuitagainst dozens of local union affiliates seeking to invalidate existing union contracts covering thousands of workers.
Eliminating collective bargaining would remove obstacles for agencies to alter working conditions and fire or discipline workers. And it could prevent federal worker unions from challenging Trump administration initiatives in court.
Trump in his order said that exempting large swaths of the federal workforce from collective bargaining was necessary to safeguard national security.
None of the agencies covered by the order are primarily involved in intelligence or national security work, the NTEU said in the lawsuit.
The order was ""instead based on a policy goal of making federal employees easier to fire and political animus against federal sector unions who have opposed the Trump Administration’s initiatives,"" the union said.
The lawsuit seeks a ruling blocking Trump's order and barring federal agencies from complying with it.
Trump in the order excluded from collective bargaining obligations agencies that he said ""have as a primary function intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative, or national security work.""
The order applies to the Justice, State, Defense, Treasury, Veterans Affairs, and Health and Human Services departments, among other agencies. The NTEU on Monday said the order affects 75% of federal workers currently represented by unions.
Trump's order significantly expanded an existing exception from collective bargaining for workers with duties affecting national security, such as certain employees of the CIA and FBI.
The agencies that sued to invalidate union contracts said the Biden administration had entered into many of the agreements in order to impede Trump from carrying out his agenda, including a drastic downsizing of the federal workforce.
The unions that were sued last week by the Trump administration have not yet responded in court, but have said the bargaining agreements are legally binding and that the lawsuit is a meritless attempt to intimidate unions and workers.",https://www.reuters.com/business/world-at-work/union-sues-block-trump-ending-collective-bargaining-many-federal-workers-2025-03-31/
US regulator OCC withdraws guidance to banks for climate-related financial risk,"WASHINGTON, March 31 (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department's Office of the Comptroller of the Currency withdrew principles providing guidance to banks for climate-related financial risk, the financial regulator said on Monday.

""The principles providing guidance to banks for climate-related financial risk are overly burdensome and duplicative,"" Acting Comptroller of the Currency Rodney Hood said in a statement.
""I will continue to look for appropriate opportunities to calibrate regulatory requirements to be effective, not excessive, while ensuring the safety, soundness and fairness of the federal banking system.""

House Democrats open probe into FCC media investigations under Trump,"WASHINGTON, March 31 (Reuters) - Three congressional Democrats sought documents on Monday from the head of the Federal Communications Commission as part of a probe into what they called ""sham"" investigations into media outlets including CBS, NBC and ABC launched by the agency under PresidentDonald Trumpto try to intimidate the news media.
The probe was announced by House of Representatives members Frank Pallone, Doris Matsui and Yvette Clarke, who asked FCC chair Brendan Carr to turn over records related to travel with Trump and to the Republican president's Florida residence, and to answer other questions.
Pallone is the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, while Matsui and Clarke are the ranking Democrats on two of its subcommittees. In a letter to Carr, they accused him of launching the investigations into media entities disfavored by Trump and his billionaire adviserElon Musk, seeking ""to target and intimidate news organizations.""
""You have weaponized the agency against news outlets,"" the three Democrats wrote. ""Your pursuit of these actions is clearly intended to punish and burden broadcasters and other media companies by inflicting incalculable reputational harm and excessive costs to defend themselves.""
A spokesperson for Carr, named chair by Trump, said that during Democratic President Joe Biden's administration, ""Democrats repeatedly weaponized our nation's communications laws and processes - including the FCC's own rules."" The spokesperson added that Carr was ""restoring the FCC's commitment to basic fairness and even-handed treatment for everyone.""
Last week, Carr said he wasopening an investigationinto the diversity practices of Walt Disney(DIS.N), opens new taband its ABC unit, saying they may violate U.S. equal employment opportunity regulations. Conservatives have argued that workplace diversity practices discriminate against majority groups including white people.
Carr has sent letters toComcast(CCZ.N), opens new tab, which owns NBC, andVerizon(VZ.N), opens new tabannouncing similar probes into diversity practices.
Days after Carr took over as chair, the FCC reinstated acomplaintover an interview on the CBS program ""60 Minutes"" with then-Vice President Kamala Harris."" The complaint was previously reviewed and dismissed by the FCC.
Trump has sued CBS for $20 billion, claiming that ""60 Minutes"" deceptively edited the interview in order to interfere in the November presidential election in which he defeated Harris, the Democratic candidate.
The three lawmakers said Carr's actions are ""an obvious effort to create additional leverage in Trump's settlement negotiations and encourage payment in a sham lawsuit in exchange for favorable regulatory outcomes.""
CBS, which is owned by Paramount Global(PARA.O), opens new tab, last week called on the FCC to dismiss the complaint ""without delay,"" but Carr rejected the idea. Paramount is currently seeking FCC approval for an $8.4 billion merger with Skydance Media.
Carr in January also reinstated complaints about how ABC News moderated a June 2024 televised debate between Biden and Trump. Biden subsequently dropped out of the race and was replaced by Harris. Carr also reinstated complaints against Comcast's NBC for allowing Harris to appear on the network's ""Saturday Night Live"" program shortly before the election.",https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/house-democrats-open-probe-into-fcc-media-investigations-2025-03-31/

Blue Origin targets late spring for next New Glenn launch after FAA probe,"WASHINGTON, March 31 (Reuters) - Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin said on Monday it is targeting ""late spring"" for the second launch of its giant New Glenn rocket, as the U.S. FAA closed an investigation into the rocket's landing failure that followed an otherwise successful debut mission in January.
The two-stage New Glenn rocketlaunched for the first timein January after years of development delays and successfully placed a satellite in orbit. But afterward, the rocket's reusable first-stage booster failed in its landing attempt on a vessel in the Atlantic Ocean, triggering an FAA probe.
Blue Origin said in a statement on Monday that the landing failure was ""due to our three BE-4 engines not re-igniting properly,"" without providing further technical detail.
The company said its investigative report into the landing failure ""identified seven corrective actions, focusing on propellant management and engine bleed control improvements, which we’re already addressing.""
""We expect to return to flight in late spring and will attempt to land the booster again,"" Blue Origin said.
A statement on Monday from the FAA, which oversees U.S. launch safety matters, confirmed the closing of its review of Blue Origin's technical probe, saying, ""The FAA will verify that Blue Origin implements corrective actions prior to the launch of the New Glenn-2 mission.""
Blue Origin's New Glenn debut was the company's first step into Earth's orbit, a pivotal moment for Bezos' space ambitions as he tries to compete withElon Musk'sSpaceX on multiple fronts - from satellite launches to moon landings to lucrative Pentagon contracts for secretive military space operations.

Big Tobacco targets Trump in hope - and fear - of change,"LONDON, March 31 (Reuters) - Big tobacco companies like British American Tobacco are lobbying U.S. President Donald Trump's administration to crack down on illegal vapes, including via import bans on Chinese devices, documents show and industry consultants said.
Tobacco groups, including BAT(BATS.L), opens new taband Altria(MO.N), opens new tab, have complained that while waiting years for their own vapes or other products to get permission for sale in the U.S., some vape makers have taken substantialmarket shareeven though authorities say they are illegal to sell.
Despite efforts to stem the flow of unauthorised vapes, they currently dominate the market. BAT estimated last year that unauthorised disposable vapes account for around 70% of almost 10 billion pounds ($12.93 billion) worth of U.S. vape sales annually. Tobacco companies say this has hit their own vape and cigarette sales.
U.S. authorities have said these unauthorised vapes, including productsmadeby Chinese firms, are illegal to import into the U.S. or sell there.
BAT and Altria haveexpressed optimismthat Trump's government will address these issues.
BAT's U.S. subsidiary Reynolds American wrote to the Office of the United States Trade Representative on March 11 to call for the government to ban imports of all disposable vapes from China and consider additional tariffs on any other Chinese-made e-cigarettes and smoking alternatives.
""The Chinese companies' unfair and illegal trading practices harm Reynolds and other law-abiding U.S. companies,"" Reynolds wrote in the letter, published by the USTR. The letter has not previously been reported.
Asked about the letter, a Reynolds spokesperson said only products that follow FDA policies and procedures should remain on the market.
The stakes are high for tobacco companies. Changes that deliver more robust enforcement of the rules governing vapes and other smoking alternatives could help them protect their market share in U.S. nicotine consumption even as tobacco use falls.
But any shift that removed or lowered legal and regulatory obstacles for currently unauthorised vapes could accelerate their growth further.
Big tobacco and vape companies want the FDA's authorisation process to be faster and clearer, but not necessarily more wholesale change, two industry consultants told Reuters.
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said President Trump makes decisions in the best interests of the American public.
Tobacco companies, as well as vape makers, are battling to get the ear of relevant U.S. leaders or officials to make the case for changes they would support, a total of three industry consultants said. They asked not to be identified in order to speak freely.
""It's no secret that everyone with a stake in this issue is trying to access the White House,"" said one of the consultants, who works for a tobacco company.
Reynolds donated $10 million to Trump-aligned super PAC Make America Great Again Inc, Federal Electoral Commission filings show.
BAT said it engages with lawmakers across the political spectrum and advocates for policies that help transition smokers to alternatives regardless of who is in the White House.
Brian Ballard, president of Ballard Partners, a lobbying firm employed by Reynolds since 2017, according to official lobbyist filings, chaired the Florida Finance Committee for Trump during his 2016 campaign.
His firm also previously employed Susie Wiles, Trump's current White House Chief of staff, and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, lobbyist filings show.
The Department of Justice did not respond to questions on Bondi's link to Ballard Partners. Ballard Partners declined to comment.
Wiles has not had any contact with Ballard Partners or BAT since January, a senior White House official told Reuters.
The FDA has been criticised by companies and some lawmakers for slow product authorisations and for failing to address the widespread trade in unauthorised products. The agency has said it needs moreresourcesto tackle these challenges.
Tobacco industry executives are concerned that the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products could be gutted or axed if the administration concludes it has failed, the consultant working for a tobacco company said.
CTP has already been targeted forcutsand could be affected by plans to restructure federal public health agenciesannouncedlast week.
The FDA has so far authorised only 34 tobacco and menthol-flavoured vape products for sale.
Reynolds said there was an ""urgent need"" to revisit how new products come to market, but it embraces FDA action to review and authorise them.
Altria pointed Reuters to remarks by CEO William Gifford, who told investors in February Altria wants quicker product authorisations and proper enforcement against illicit products.
The head of the Vapor Technology Association, Tony Abboud, however said the current system creates a steep barrier for entry and had essentially outlawed flavoured vapes that can help smokers quit.
A significant change of approach was needed, Abboud told Reuters.
The association says it represents ""industry-leading manufacturers of vapor devices, e-liquids, and flavorings, distributors and suppliers, as well as retailers.""
Abboud met with Trump in 2024. Afterwards, in September 2024, Trump posted on Truth Social pledging to ""save"" vaping.

Insight: How the Trump family took over a crypto firm as it raised hundreds of millions,"LONDON/NEW YORK, March 31 (Reuters) - As World Liberty Financial raised more than half a billion dollars, President Donald Trump’s family took control of the crypto venture and grabbed the lion’s share of those funds, aided by governance terms that industry experts say favor insiders.
Launched last fall, World Liberty’s goal is to allow people to access financial services using cryptocurrencies and without intermediaries like banks in what is called decentralized finance, or DeFi. But it has yet to launch a public platform and has reported only a small staff, a review of the project shows.
Even so, World Liberty said in mid-March it had raised $550 million selling so-called governance tokens. Most of those sales took place after Trump’s election win in November, Reuters calculations show.
The tokens, which go by the symbol $WLFI, give holders the right to vote on changes to the project’s underlying code and to signal their opinion on its direction and plans. They cannot be traded.
As its fundraising got traction, World Liberty disclosed in January that the Trump family had taken control of the business, a review of changes in the fine print on World Liberty’s website shows. Two of its co-founders, crypto entrepreneurs Zak Folkman and Chase Herro, were replaced as the controlling parties of World Liberty by an entity in which the Trump family holds a 60% stake.
The changes have not been previously reported.
Overall, the Trump family now has a claim on 75% of net revenues from token sales and 60% from World Liberty operations once the core business gets going. The arrangement means the Trump family is currently entitled to about $400 million in fees. After World Liberty's co-founders take their cut, the crypto venture will be left with 5% of the $550 million raised to date to build the platform, according to Reuters calculations.
The arrangements, including the Trump family’s large share of the project’s revenues and the non-tradeable nature of the governance tokens, make World Liberty unusually centralized for the industry, according to a survey of the practices of the five largest DeFi lending platforms and interviews with four U.S. academics who study the crypto industry.
""It's hard for me to see any economic benefit to the owner of these tokens,"" said Jim Angel, an associate professor at Georgetown University who has written about DeFi regulation.
David Krause, a longtime finance professor at Marquette University in Milwaukee who recently published a study of World Liberty, said that the structure of the project “pretty much excludes public investors or token holders from any meaningful financial participation.”
A White House spokesperson referred questions about World Liberty to the Trump Organization. The Trump Organization's chief legal officer and the president's two older sons, who are executives at the company, did not respond to requests for comment.
The Trump Organization announced in January that the president's investments, assets and business interests would be held in a trust managed by his children and he would play no role in day-to-day operations or decision-making. The family's business also retained an attorney to serve as an ethics adviser to ""avoid any perceived conflicts of interest.""
Folkman and Herro did not reply to Reuters questions in person and in writing. In a post on social media platform X on March 14, World Liberty said it “is a DeFi project with a tremendous mission to build and democratize a new financial system for the benefit of millions.”
At a conference in February, Herro said the plan was to open crypto investing to everyday Americans such as teachers, dentists and firemen. His business partner, Donald Trump Jr, the president's son, has complained about the family being excluded from traditional banking in the aftermath of his father's first term.
The Trump family’s investment in World Liberty ties the personal fortunes of a sitting U.S. president to an asset class that sits at the outer edges of both risk and regulation.
Trump has promised to be the “crypto president,” who will popularize its mainstream use in America. He has said he backs crypto because it can improve the banking system and increase the dominance of the U.S. dollar.
At the same time, the Trump family, long rooted in skyscrapers and country clubs, has opened beachheads in crypto, quickly gaining hundreds of millions of dollars. A so-called meme coin promoted by Trump has generated at least $349 million in fees for entities connected to the president, according to crypto data firm Chainalysis.
On Monday, the Trump family deepened its crypto interests, as a company formed with the president's elder sons, Eric and Donald Trump Jr., took a minority stake in a newly-formed bitcoin producer called American Bitcoin. Eric Trump will become the chief strategy officer of the new firm, which will focus on mining bitcoin and aims to become publicly listed, the statement said.
The prospect of Trump and his family benefiting from deregulation has drawn criticism from hispolitical opponentsand some government ethics experts who say it creates the potential for conflicts of interest and influence peddling.
""You've got the guy in charge who is responsible for his own regulation,"" said Ross Delston, a former U.S. banking regulator who has acted as an expert witness on anti-money laundering issues for the government.
Delston also pointed to the potential for people buying $WLFI tokens to earn political favor. It would be “the perfect vehicle,” he said, for governments or oligarchs overseas “to funnel money to the president.""
World Liberty has attracted well-heeled buyers: Almost 70% of the money raised came from wallets that spent at least $100,000, and more than 50% was buys of $1 million or more, according to a Reuters analysis of publicly available information on transactions.
While buyers of $WLFI gave their names to the venture, the identity of nearly all of those big spenders is hidden from public view by anonymous crypto wallets. Among ahandful of buyers that Reuters was able to identify,several said they bought into the token because they believed Trump’s involvement would help it succeed as a business.
World Liberty’s beginnings lie in the convergence of two obscure figures on the crypto scene and some of the most powerful people in American politics.
Folkman and Herro entered Trump circles via the family of New York real estate mogul Steve Witkoff, a longtime Trump friend who is now also his envoy to the Mideast.
The two crypto entrepreneurs had already collaborated on several companies together focused on making money from online ventures. Their business background includes past instances of dissolution, litigation and unpaid debts, according to corporate records, state filings and U.S. court documents. Early in his career, Folkman offered seminars on how to “date hotter girls.”
Steve Witkoff said he was introduced to the pair by one of his sons, when speaking about how the deal came together on a crypto podcast hosted in September by the Trump family.
After meeting the two crypto businessmen and hearing them speak about the difficulties of getting credit in traditional finance, Witkoff said he thought of the Trumps. He set up a meeting with Donald Trump and his two oldest sons for Herro and Folkman to describe the opportunities of DeFi. The Trumps, Witkoff said, were smitten: “We said, ‘Let’s go pursue it.’”
Witkoff did not respond to requests for comment.
Despite Trump’s backing, token sales were slow at first. According to a U.S. regulatory filing by the company dated October 30 - around two weeks after World Liberty sales had begun - the venture’s total amount sold was only $2.7 million.
Then, on November 25, less than three weeks after Trump won the U.S. election, Justin Sun, a Hong Kong-based crypto entrepreneur who was fighting a U.S. securities fraud lawsuit, announced that he’d sunk $30 million into $WLFI - the amount the company said it needed to jumpstart operations.
“His amount was pretty meaningful at that point,” said “Ogle”, a World Liberty security adviser who only goes by that pseudonym and has appeared in video interviews with his face obscured by a bandana and sunglasses.
Sun has said his investment has since risen to $75 million. As well as its single-largest known investor, he has become an advisor to the project. Meanwhile, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in February paused its case against him, citing public interest.
Sun didn’t respond to a request for comment. The SEC declined to comment.
Initially, Herro and Folkman were listed as the “sole directors and members” of World Liberty Financial Inc, the main entity developing the platform, according to World Liberty’s terms and conditions, last updated in October.
On January 19 and 20 - the day of Trump’s inauguration - World Liberty raised almost $300 million in a frenzy of token sales, according to a Reuters analysis of blockchain data. Around that time, its website was updated to say WLF Holdco LLC now controlled World Liberty Financial Inc. And DT Marks DeFi LLC – Trump’s company – now held about 60% of WLF Holdco. It did not disclose who owns the rest.
The president’s son, Eric, also gained a seat on WLF Holdco’s board of managers.
Reuters could not ascertain the terms of any deals between Trump and his partners that led to the changes.
Angel, the Georgetown professor, said the corporate structure had put several layers of entities between Trump and World Liberty, protecting the president from any potential legal action should something go wrong. “He can say: ‘You can't sue me because I'm not involved’,” Angel said.
The five largest DeFi lending platforms, as ranked by data site DefiLlama, all have governance tokens that give holders voting rights. But unlike World Liberty, those five platforms either allocated the majority of their governance tokens to be given away for free to users, sold them to venture capitalists in return for money to build the platform, or paid them to partners in return for building the project.
World Liberty governance tokens lack another critical feature of those issued by other DeFi platforms – the ability of token holders to vote for the platform to pay them a share of its profits. World Liberty has told token holders any vote to breach its existing deals with Trump and other backers would have no force, according to a 13-page description of the business released in October.
Folkman told a New York audience on March 18 that the company is working on three main products, including a “lend and borrow” market that would be announced soon and a personal finance application. World Liberty also said in March that it is planning tolaunch a stablecoin, known as USD1, that will be backed by assets such as U.S. Treasuries and redeemable for a dollar.
One company that World Liberty has collaborated with is Ondo Finance. The startup, founded in 2021 by former Goldman Sachs employees, lets users buy blockchain-based tokens backed by U.S. Treasuries and other assets such as money market funds, thereby earning interest. The two companies said in a statement that they would collaborate to “advance the adoption of tokenized real-world assets.”
“They're all in early stages, but we're exploring what they're doing at a very high level,” Nathan Allman, Ondo’s CEO, told Reuters.
While World Liberty has also used some of the money it raisedto invest in other cryptocurrencies, it has yet to launch a DeFi platform.
Two software developers listed on World Liberty's website are based in Romania, according to their social media profiles. Octavian Lojnita was previously a developer at Dough Finance, a Herro and Folkman project that collapsed last year after being hacked, according to Lojnita's online profile and the publicly available source code of Dough. The online handle for a second developer at Dough matches that of Bogdan Purnavel, also at World Liberty.
Lojnita declined to discuss his involvement in World Liberty. Purnavel referred questions to World Liberty.
The coding for contracts posted to the project’s blockchain – a public-facing database – shows that World Liberty “appears to still be in development, with several functionalities not yet implemented or fully operational,” according to a review in late March by CertiK, a cybersecurity company that audits projects for security flaws.",https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/how-trump-family-took-over-crypto-firm-it-raised-hundreds-millions-2025-03-31/

"Democratic senators urge Trump to revamp China trade ties, revise free trade deals","WASHINGTON, March 31 (Reuters) - Three Democratic senators on Monday urged U.S. PresidentDonald Trumpto ""dramatically revise"" the United States' trade relationship with China along with 14 free trade agreements, providing a boost to his push to revamp U.S. trade policy.
In a letter to the Republican president, Senators Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and Gary Peters and Elissa Slotkin of Michigan welcomed the comprehensive review of trade policy Trump has ordered and his push to rebuild the U.S. manufacturing base.
Trump has upended U.S. trade policy and unsettled financial markets with a series oftariffsaimed at competitors like China and neighbors like Canada and Mexico and specific sectors like autos and metals. He plans to announce more tariffs aimed atall countrieswith big trade surpluses on Wednesday.
The policies have sparked criticism from free trade groups and some firms, but also support from unions and some Democratic lawmakers, underscoring the bipartisan nature of concerns over the loss of 4.3 million manufacturing jobs since 2001.
The Democratic senators said changes were urgently needed after what they called flawed trade decisions made by Democrats and Republicans on trade ties with China and other countries, while calling on Trump to keep the needs of workers in mind.
""Free trade and globalization have left us with offshored manufacturing, devastated communities, workers out of a job or in jobs with lower wages, and supply chains overly dependent on our adversaries in too many areas,"" they wrote, noting that their states had suffered disproportionately.
The senators urged Trump to focus on a ""pro-American worker trade policy"" by rethinking a 2000 decision to grant China permanent normal trade relations status, which paved the way for its entry into the World Trade Organization.
The Trump administration should also rethink its 14 free trade deals with 20 countries, including the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement and take steps to strengthen trade enforcement mechanisms, including through ending a trade rule called ""de minimis"" that allows goods valued at less than $800 to enter the country duty-free and with minimal inspections.
Trump ordered the end of the loophole,which allowed nearly 1.4 billion packages to enter the U.S. last year, but quickly paused it due to logistical issues.
The senators said they viewed Trump's favored instrument of tariffs as an important tool for leveling the playing field, but noted that it could take years to impact supply chains.
To ensure the tariffs worked, the administration also needed to make investments, enact Buy America requirements and tax incentives, like those in the Inflation Reduction Act passed under former President Joe Biden that Trump has vowed to undo.
Steps were also needed to keep corporations in check with equitable tax rates and strong antitrust laws, and empowering workers to join unions, they said.",https://www.reuters.com/world/us/democratic-senators-urge-trump-revamp-china-trade-ties-revise-free-trade-deals-2025-03-31/
